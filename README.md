#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include:
1)the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), 
2)the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, 
3)the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and 
4)the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
  -  Waterfall is a stricter, more linear methodology that limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages in the SDLC. Agile, by contrast, gives teams a margin of flexibility at each stage of the SDLC, enabling them to change the course of a project and incorporate new feedback. This adaptability is often a competitive advantage and a necessity for modern software.
  - Waterfall may work for software development projects where the following is true:

The requirements for the project are clearly defined, meaning there is no need for detailed planning, analysis and design processes.
The total work necessary to complete the requirements is small in scope.
There are only a handful of developers, and they can collaborate efficiently without an Agile framework to guide them.
The deadline for the project is flexible.
Under these conditions, Waterfall can be preferable because it doesn't require as much planning and orchestration.
Stages of SDLC	AGILE METHODOLOGY	WATERFALL METHODOLOGY
Planning	During the planning stage of the SDLC, developers establish a reasonable scope of changes that they want to implement.	During planning, developers create a list of changes they want to implement.
Analysis	After deciding what to implement, developers perform analysis to determine how they will do it. Following an Agile approach, they break the work into small, discrete tasks.	 The diverse set of changes that developers are targeting makes it challenging to run a complete analysis of each one and generate specific, detailed plans. As a result, developers might only achieve a basic analysis of what is required for the design. In this scenario, developers might fill in the details once work is underway.
Design	Agile doesn't necessarily shape the design stage, which focuses on defining software architectures, components and interfaces associated with the planned changes. However, an Agile design philosophy might encourage the use of small, modular units within application architectures and interfaces since this fits the Agile concept of keeping tasks discrete and manageable.	a Waterfall approach to design typically means having only a basic vision for the application architecture, components and interfaces and planning to work out the details later.
Implementation	During the implementation stage, developers make only the specific functionality they've decided to build. Even if there are other requirements to address -- for example, if there are known segments of the application code that could be optimized to improve performance -- they ignore those for the time being to focus on just one predefined task.	During Waterfall-style implementation, a set of development teams write the code necessary to build the features or other changes within the project. Along the way, they might decide to take on additional tasks that they didn't originally plan on so that those changes can roll out with the project, not wait until a new project starts.
Testing	An Agile testing strategy breaks software tests into small units, and then the team performs them incrementally. Small, incremental testing makes the testing team's workload estimable and gives them the flexibility to adapt to failures in test.	All changes are implemented together and tested together. Due to the volume of changes that appear simultaneously within the application, it may be unclear which updates cause which problems in testing.
Deployment	Agile doesn't necessarily have to change the IT team's approach to deployment, which means moving a new application release candidate into production. However, in Agile, deployments happen more frequently than in Waterfall.	As with Agile, Waterfall doesn't dictate a particular deployment method. However, the large number of changes implemented during the project typically makes deployment complex

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Prompt engineering helps prevent asking vague questions and getting confusing answers  by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need."


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is " Tell me everything about education"
Improved prompt " Tell me about the history of education in Nigeria"
The improved prompt is more effective because I will get a more focused answer.
